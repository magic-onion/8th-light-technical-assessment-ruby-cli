# 8th Light Code Submission - ruby - Alexander Truong

Hello, and thanks for using my cli

This command line interface can:

  * type in a query to the Google Books API (by title)
  * Display 5 results from that query that include the author, title, and publishing company
  * Allow a user to save one of the search results to a local reading list.
  * view the local reading list

**To Install:**

Clone the repo

CD into directory

run the command "bundle install" (previous installation of ruby required)

This API Key is restricted to the Google Books API

**To Run**

simply use the command "ruby run.rb" on the command line after installation.


I hope you enjoy it!
