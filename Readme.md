# 8th Light Code Submission - Ruby

Hello, and thanks for using my cli

This command line interface can:

  * Type in a query to the Google Books API (by title)
  * Display 5 results from that query that include the author, title, and publishing company
  * Allow a user to save one of the search results to a local reading list.
  * View the local reading list

**To Install:**

Clone the repo

CD into directory

Run the command "bundle install" (previous installation of ruby, bundler gem required)

You _may_ have to delete the 'Gemfile.lock' file before running "bundle install" for a successful installation

This API Key is restricted to the Google Books API

**To Run**

Simply use the command "ruby run.rb" on the command line after installation.



I hope you enjoy it!
